# SITL1-Introduction_to_MATLAB
Simple matlab commands on matrices<br/>

We did the following -<br/>
1)Find eigenvalue and eigen vector<br/>
2)save only row of magic 4 matrix<br/>
3)2nd and 4th column elements into z vmatrix <br/>
4)Corner element of the magic 4 in a matrix<br/>
5)for any number of r and c find the end things 1st and last r and c both<br/>
6)now convert all elemente of 1st row to -1<br/>
7) delete 1st row<br/>
8)Plot sine and cosine waveforms<br/>
